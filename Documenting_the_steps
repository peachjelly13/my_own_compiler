Steps involved in constructing my very own compiler:

- Three important parts to look for when making a compiler: A lexer, A parser, A code generator.
- On one end, a tree-walk interpreter is simple, portable, and slow. On the other, native code is complex and platform-specific but fast. Bytecode sits in the middle.
